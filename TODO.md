# Fixing Invalid LatLng Errors in Ghost Bus App - Complete

## Breakdown of Approved Plan Steps

1. **[x] Edit frontend/src/App.js**:
   - Add validation and filtering in the WebSocket data handler to skip invalid vehicles (non-finite lat/lon) before updating state.
   - Filter initial vehicles from API in loadInitialVehicles to only include valid ones.
   - Enhance the filteredVehicles computation with Number.isFinite checks for redundancy.
   - Update statistics to be based on the now-filtered vehicles state.
   - Add console.warn logs for skipped invalid vehicles.

2. **[x] Verify the edit**: Apply changes using edit_file, confirm success from user response.

3. **[x] Restart frontend service**: Use docker-compose restart frontend to apply changes without full project restart.

4. **[x] Test the fix**:
   - Launch browser to http://localhost:3000.
   - Monitor console for absence of "Invalid LatLng object" errors (none observed post-fix).
   - Verify map renders only valid markers.
   - Check WebSocket data flow continues without errors (connected successfully).
   - Confirm statistics (total, ghost counts) are accurate based on valid vehicles.
   - Interact with filters (ghost-only, route) to ensure they work on filtered data.

5. **[x] Update TODO.md**: Mark completed steps, note any issues (none; fix resolved errors).

6. **[x] Close task**: Errors resolved; project runs without LatLng issues.
